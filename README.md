## Description

In this assignment, the index was given and I had to style the web pages according to the references given. So first I linked the stylesheet in all the article pages including index.html. This website includes a homepage and 4 articles which are the Main reactor, Bad motivator, Wookies taking over, and Human-cyborg communication. At first, there was no image in the 4th article(Human-cyborg communication) so I added an image for that article in the HTML file and then I did the necessary styling for it.
